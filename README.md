Poetry dedicated to Eleanor Aw [ Work in Progress]

Out of mummy's comfortable womb, through the birth canal, you arrived at a perplexing place 

full of strange faces behind masks, bright lights and the rush of cold air - 

Onto mummy's chest you were placed. How well you could latched to mummy for the very first time! 

For the whole 10 months (40 weeks + 6), after all the Prof. Biswas visits, scans and prayers, 

it culminated in your grand entry. 



Into a perplexing time of human history you were born into. 

Against the backdrop of the once-in-a-century pandemic (Covid-19) 

Started in Wuhan, China in Nov 2019, waves of infection has swept away more than 3.99 million lives. 

To put that number in context: That is 70% of the Singapore population - perished.

An unnecessary human tradegy of epic proportions that came with the inexorable rise of China

Everyone had to now wear a mask - it is difficult to imagine otherwise 

Yet the origin of Covid-19 has not been determined (natural spillover or a lab-leak?)



Perplexing the world it may be, 

However perplexing the situation we may eventually find ourselves in,

Don't forget we may be perplexed, but never in despair. 2 Cor 4:8
