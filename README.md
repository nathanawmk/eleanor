Poetry dedicated to Eleanor Aw

23 June 2021

you were born into this perplexing world.

Into a world that was battling a pandemic - Covid-19 - since 2019 

Subsequent waves of infection has swept away 3.9 million lives

Yet the origin of Covid-19 has not been determined (lab?)


Into a perplexing ward full of faces behind mask you came

where Mummy and Daddy were wearing mask.



For 10 months (40 weeks, Day 6), Daddy and Mummy was wondering how you look. 

First thing that Daddy and Mummy said when we first saw you was "Thank God"

Took you 13.5 hours 

Many will wish for their children to be good-looking, healthy and intelligent.

To have a good life, that is.

Mummy and Daddy deepest wish for you is to personally know God and his Son, Jesus.

For knowing Him will unravel the perplexities of the world. Behind the mysteries of the universe and the pain, suffering, there you find God.
